## Description
    
I wanted to create the back end portion of an E-Commerce website as an exercise to gain experience using Sequelize as an ORM to create models for MySQL, and using Express routes for handling CRUD requests.

Users can use this project to build a database of products, categories and tags, and manipulate the database via CRUD requests through Insomnia or Postman or similar platform.

In completing this project, I learned about using Sequelize as an ORM and Insomnia to test routes and CRUD requests.

## Installation
    
To use the employee tracker, clone the repository by running "git clone `git@github.com:the64man1/E-Commerce-Back-End.git`' on your console. Then use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Next you will need to add your own SQL password in the connection function in the index.js file, then create the 'employee_trackerdb' in MySQL by running a query in MySQL Workbench using the schema described in the 'schema.sql' file. Then you can run the command 'npm start' to begin using the Employee Tracker. Sample data is included in the seed.sql files.
    
## Usage
    
Users are free to use this exercise as a tool for structuring back end databases and routes, and build out the functionality of this application.

As there is no front end, users must use Insomnia or Postman or similar platform for testing routes and CRUD requests.
